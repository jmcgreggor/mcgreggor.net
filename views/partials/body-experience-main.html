                <p class="p-main">In the late 90s, I was faced with a decision regarding my career: take a chance on something that I was interested in but had little experience, or go the route that I was more familiar with. Looking back over twenty years, I am glad that I took that chance...and that someone took a chance on me. </p>

                <h2>SUPPORT</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">I started my IT career in the late 90's at a software company, diving head first into application support by learning to troubleshoot MUMPS programming code which was used as the language for credit union software. Have you seen the movie Office Space? My experience evolved as I began to support other systems such as VMS operating systems and SQL databases. Branching out in my career, I changed companies and roles, moving on to providing operational support of financial trading and accounting software while learning to support server-side operations.</p>

                <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">In the mid 2000's I was given the opportunity to gain a different perspective of IT by becoming a business systems analyst. It was in this position that was able to understand IT through the eyes of the business, by taking business needs and translating them into technical requirements. This was also a personal growth experience as this was the first role where I was solely responsible for managing the business relationship with IT.</p>

                <h2>OPERATIONS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">The next three career moves were all similar in nature. I switched back to the technical side of IT, but focused more on systems and infrastructure by taking a much deeperdive into server and network operations (including virtualization) while also learning something about email and ERP solutions as well as MS domain operations. This also began my shift away from financial institutions and into manufacturing. I continued down the operational path when I joined BMW. It was here that my experience multiplied by taking on a similar role but in a vastly larger and more complex environment.</p>

                <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">Not long after joining BMW I took on my first real project assignment: leading the migration of DNS off of Microsoft based DNS in the Americas and onto a dedicated bind based appliance. An additional level of complexity is that it directly impacted all line side robotics at the manufacturing plant. After successfully completing my first assignment I took on an even larger challenge: converting and migrating all group identities to a centrally managed Identity Management solution. Over 100 systems were impacted by this which required closely timed coordination of activities, including the migration from one legacy domain. My final major project with the operations group was the relocation of one of our primary data-centers which provided services for all corporate entities in the Americas. This relocation effort covered the shut-down, movement, and start-up of hundreds of servers and all networking and storage (NAS, SAN) equipment all while not impacting business operations.</p>

                <h2>PRODUCTS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">After nearly 15 years working in the operations side of IT, I decided to switch over to the build side of the house. In 2014 I joined with the Mobile Apps & Services team of BMW. It was here that I was first introduced to the Agile way of product development, as well as development of mobile apps. This was an incredibly exciting time for me as I was able to work directly with the business (as well as some customers) while lead teams in the design and development of some really great products. I was even able to develop some of that software as well.</p>

                <h2>STRATEGY</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">As the team expanded, we needed to establish way to operate in a way that was sustainable in order to continue to be a creative team that builds great software and enjoys a fun and collaborative environment from with a massive enterprise organization. Stepping out of product/project delivery, I switch to more group wide strategic topics such as agile coaching, financial steering, process improvement, internal marketing, resource planning, compliance, and general group strategies. We have now grown to the size, and product volume, where I have a full team to support these activities. I also serve as a solutions consultant for other teams developing mobile software.</p>

                <h2>FUTURE</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p-main">The greatest lesson that I have learned in my career is that you should have a master plan. As my past 20 years was focused on developing my skill set and establishing myself as a multi-functional IT professional; my next 20 years will be dedicated to using my experience and breadth of knowledge to helping others live up to their full potential.</p>

                  <p class="p-main">My first enlistment was with the 913 MXS of the US Air Force Reserves, serving as an Avionics Specialist, working pn the Communications & Navigation systems of C130 aircraft. It was there where I became very interested in technology, as I learned how to work on various avaition elecronics systems, such as radio transmission, cryptographic commuication, and radar systems.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="p-main">Feeling like I had not truly completed my journey, I chose to re-enlist after taking a short break. Wanting a slightly different experience, I also decided to switch career fields and joined the 111th Security Forces Squadron of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. It was with the Security Forces (SF) that I had learned some of the most valuable life lessons, traveled to some interesting locations, and met some of the most inspiring people. Many of the leaderships skills that I use today still stem from what I learned being a part of the 111th.</p>
